/*
 * This example shows ho you can use the Geometry library to calculate the forward and inverse kinematics of an arbitrary length kinematic chain. The kinematic chain is specified
 * Denavit-Hartenburg parameters, if you're not familiar with them watch this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA9tm0gTln8 . The forward kinematics calculates the location of the
 * end effector given a set of joint angles defined by D-H parameters stored in the 'chain' member. The inverse kinematics (IK) calculate a set of joint angles given a position for the end effector.
 * In doing so it also sets these angles on the links in the chain member.

// In addition to the D-H parameters, the joint also needs to specify how the D-H parameters change in response to it's movement. This let's the inverse kinematics algorithm know how useful the joints movement is in reaching
// the goal position. You can define how the joint moves by subclassing Link and overriding the Move function. The function should modify the link's D-H parameters in some way proportional to the 'amount' parameter.
